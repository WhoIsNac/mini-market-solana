## Introduction

The Solana Marketplace with Candy-Shop and Candtmachine is a decentralized application (DApp) that empowers users to buy, sell, and trade digital assets directly on the Solana blockchain. This project leverages the power of smart contracts to create a trustless environment where users can transact with each other without intermediaries.
